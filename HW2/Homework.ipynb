    "On the Sunday morning of May 18, 1980 in south-western Washington, Mount St. Helens experienced a shallow earthquake registering a magnitude 5.1 on the Richter scale. Combined with uplifting pressure from a magma pocket below the peak, the north face of Mount St. Helens suffered a catastrophic landslide. This landslide, the largest ever recorded, aided in the release of the underground pressure and resulting in an explosive volcanic eruption which sent a column of ash over 24km (>80,000 feet) into the atmosphere. The heat from the eruption created massive lahars, volcanic mudslides created from rapidly melted glacial snow and ice mixed with volcanic lava, ash, older soil and crushed rocks. The blast itself traveled over 480km/hr (>300mph) knocking down trees and anything else that stood in its path. In the end about 60 people (reports vary from 59-64) were dead, some areas around the mountain were buried in over 600 feet of ash, a large percentage of Washington lay under more than a half a foot of ash. The ash cloud deposited measurable amounts of ash across North America and due to the amount of gas and ash deposited into the atmosphere the ash cloud. In less than 2 weeks gas and ash from the cloud circled the globe and lowered global temperatures for a short period of time.\n",

    "For this homework assignment we will explore the mapping of a dataset provided to us by Jeff Falgout from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). This is a small subset of a larger dataset created by Larry Mastin (also from the USGS) which was modeled to simulate the ash cloud for the first 96 hours after the eruption. "
